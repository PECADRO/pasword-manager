*IMPORTANT* LOGIN DETAILS ARE NEVER SAVED, SO YOU MUST REMEMBER FIRST LOGIN DETAILS (Username/Password)

## How Password Encryption Works
This extension uses a simple but educational encryption approach:
1. When you save a password, it gets transformed using our encryption rules:
   - Letters are reversed 
   - Numbers are shifted 
   - Special characters remain unchanged
2. To get your original password:
   - find the the encrypted password
   - Enter it back into the extension
   - The extension will show you the original password

Example:
- Original: "Password123"
- Encrypted: "Kzhhdliw678"
- When you need the original, enter "Kzhhdliw678" to get back "Password123"
